My motivation to under go this kind of training is to pursue a career that's aligned with the course that I took in college.
I have taken different types of jobs in my past, such as janitor, promodiser, factory worker, kitchen crew at one of the well-known fast food restaurants here in the Philippines, sales utility clerk, and customer service representative. It was an amazing journey, and I have gained a lot of learning from the different types of experiences, such as how to deal with different types of customers and co-workers, how to cope with a fast-paced environment, and work ethics.
